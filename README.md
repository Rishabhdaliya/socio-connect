# Socio-connect

An open source application built using the new router, server components and everything new in Next.js 13.

## About this project

This project as an experiment to see how a modern app (with features like authentication, subscriptions, API routes, static pages for docs ...etc) would work in Next.js 13 and server components.

**This is not a starter template.**

A few people have asked me to turn this into a starter. I think we could do that once the new features are out of beta.

## Note on Performance

> **Warning**
> This app is using the unstable releases for Next.js 13 and React 18. The new router and app dir is still in beta and not production-ready.
> **Expect some performance hits when testing the dashboard**.
> If you see something broken, you can ping me [@shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn).

## Why not tRPC, Turborepo or X?

I might add this later. For now, I want to see how far we can get using Next.js only.

If you have some suggestions, feel free to create an issue.
